## PEP8 Assignment
Similar to driving a car, programmers tend to develop their own methodology of writing code, which is acceptable so long as it gets the job done.
However, just as one has to pass the driver's license examination with an in-the-car demonstration, coders should be able to demonstrate their competency and mastery of coding syntax guidelines, including consistency, readability, and structure.

You may choose any one of your scripts (i.e., utility script, a conversion script, sparse data challenge script, sandbox challenge script, or project script) to be graded based on Python's [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) syntax guidelines.
Upload your script to this directory (keep the original name of your file) and tag the PEP8 Issue with your commit comment.
Be certain to include a purpose statement for your script in the comments at the top so I know what your script is supposed to do.


### Learning Objectives
* Tractable and reusable code development
* Clear and concise code documentation
* Git workflows

### Submission
You may tag your code to the PEP8 Issue if it already exists in this repository; otherwise, you can can make a copy of it (e.g., if it's your utility script) here and also tag the Issue.
See issue for grading.
