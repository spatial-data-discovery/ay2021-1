2020-10-18   Project Initialization 
           + Created project folder on git (ay2021-1/project/xlpeng)
           + Updated README file
           + Created xlpeng-process-doc.txt


2020-10-21   Topic Brainstorming
           + Searched on the Internet to see which topic I am interested in
           + Searched related data to see if it is easy to for future manipulating


2020-10-22   Topic Decision 
           + Decided to focus on visualizing the COVID-19 cases in the U.S.


2020-10-25   Data Sources
           + Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States, published by the New York Times
                 - https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
           + COVID-19 Data, published by the Center for Systems Science and 
             Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University 
                 - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
           + US Shape file 
                 - https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html 


2020-11-01   Data Decision
           + Decided to use the data from the NYT because it doesn't 
             include non-necessary information 
           + Considered ways to visualize the data
           + Decided to use the choropleth map


2020-10-20   Python Script and Visualization
           + Started writing python script to process the data
           + Finished coding part with newly created csv files
           + Generated visualization with created csv file by QGIS
                 - import the U.S. shape file
                 - import cvs file for each date
                 - join the two layers so that QGIS can color each state with number of cases
                 - adjust the symbology of the map


2020-10-21   Website
           + Created the RMD file for the project
           + Updated title and subtitles

2020-10-23   Animation

           + Adjusted the title, legend, and dates for each layer 
           + Exported images for each dates from QGIS
           + Generated GIF using EZGIF online tool
                 - https://ezgif.com/maker
           + Converted GIF to MP4 using EZGIF online tool
                 - https://ezgif.com/gif-to-mp4
           + Emailed Professor Davis with animation file


             Documentation
           + Updated the process doc
           + Started writing the email
           + Developed the frontend
