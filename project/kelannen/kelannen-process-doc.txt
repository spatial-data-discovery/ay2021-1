2020-11-04  Created kelannen folder in ay2021-1 project directory
            + Created project process document
            + Created README
            + Discussed project ideas, decided to go with crop yields
            and maybe try seeing if there exists a correlation between that
            and another variable (for instance temperature)

2020-11-18 Decided topic and main sources, started working on code
            + Decided to do crop yields in Africa countries
            + https://common-data.carto.com/tables/africa_adm0/public,
            the Africa geojson
            + http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC, crop yield information
            went to the bulk download section on this page and downloaded it
            for Africa
            + Started working on the script as I decided to use it to do the
            majority of the cleaning and formatting of the data and also to 
            merge data sets

2020-11-19 Script, Visualization, and finding weather data
            + Continued script from where I left of and added two different 
            focusses so that I can compare total crop yields and yields for 
            specific types of crops
            + Created graphs for everything and added the code to create
            the visualization(s)
            + Created the videos from the animation/visualization
            + Looked at various sources for weather data: started out 
            looking for temperature ended up with precipitation
            + https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/maps/index.html
            + https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/SH.Ts+dSST.txt
            + https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
            + http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/Temperature/
            + Added precipitation data it to the script and the 
            visualizations and animations
            + https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=AG.LND.PRCP.MM&country= 
            filtered the data some there and then made minor changes before 
            loading into the script and doing the rest of the changes there
            + Started working on documentation

2020-11-20 Finish documentation, work on website and other uploads
            + Finish and upload process document
            + Email Davis the code and other requirements
            + Develop and test the frontend
