2020-11-05  Initial planning for project
            * Thought about focusing on projected sea level rise.
            * Planned to visualize coastlines over time using 
              coastlines over time using elevation data.

2020-11-08  Found potential dataset with sea level projections
            * https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00263/full

2020-11-11  Decided to change project to look at US unemployment data
            * Topic seems relevant to current events as we try to work through
              the COVID-19 pandemic.
            * Found dataset from US Bureau of Labor Statistics:
              https://www.bls.gov/web/laus.supp.toc.htm

2020-11-13  Started working on data processing script
            * Created functions to read in unemployment .xlsx dataset
              and reformat data

2020-11-16  Attempted to create visualizations in Python
            * Found helpful tutorial:
              https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-an-interactive-geographical-map-using-python-f4c5197e23e0
            * Downloaded US shapefiles:
              https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html

2020-11-17  Switched to using R for visualizations
            * Had issues using Python, couldn't figure out how to show Alaska
              and Hawaii next to continental US.
            * Found good resources on creating map visualizations in R:
              https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usmap/vignettes/mapping.html
            * Created basic R script to visualize unemployment data

2020-11-18  Decided to visualize COVID cases along side unemployment rate
            * Found CDC dataset with daily case numbers by state:
              https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36
            * Created functions in Python script to convert data to
              monthly new cases by state.
            * Downloaded population dataset from Census Bureau:
              https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html#par_textimage
            * Adjusted COVID cases to state populations.
            * Found another R visualization tutorial:
              https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usmap/vignettes/advanced-mapping.html
            * Decided to use circles of different sizes to represent COVID cases for
              each state.
            * Has benefit of both datasets being shown on the same map instead of
              having side-by-side maps which might not show any potential
              trends/correlations as well.
            * Found dataset from Google with coordinates for the center of
              each state:
              https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv
            * Added COVID cases to visualization in R script

2020-11-19  Finished visualization
            * Finalized color scheme for map and adjusted titles/labels
            * Found tutorial on animating series of images:
              https://stackoverflow.com/questions/753190/programmatically-generate-video-or-animated-gif-in-python
            * Created Python script to make GIF of individual plots
            * Recorded metadata for datasets in README.md
            * Began working on project website


2020-11-20  Finished project
            * Completed REAMDE.md
            * Finalized website prose
            * Re-structured project folder with directories for input data and
              Intermediate output files
