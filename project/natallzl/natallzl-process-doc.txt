2020-10-18  Created natallzl folder in ay2021-1 project directory
            + Created project process document
            + Created README

            Created blank template project-natallzl.Rmd in spatial-data-discovery.github.io repository

2020-11-01  Looked for topic ideas and datasets
            * CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions
                * https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions
                * https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data
            * glacier change from 1850 to present
                * https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/insitu-glaciers-elevation-mass?tab=doc
            * wildfire occurrences in the US
                * https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/real-time-data/wildfire
            * hurricanes and sea surface temperature
                * https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/

2020-11-03  Decided on a topic and found a dataset
            * historic hurricane data (1980-present) and sea surface temperature
            * hurricane data: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ib-v4-access

2020-11-04  Project progress discussion

            Found sea surface temperature data
            * EarthData "NOAA Smith and Reynolds Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface
                          Temperature (ERSST) Level 4 Monthly Version 5 Dataset in netCDF"

2020-11-05  Decided to scrap temp data for now and focus on hurricane data

2020-11-08  Looked up visualization ideas using QGIS
            * https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/automating_map_creation.html
            * https://medium.com/@tjukanov/geospatial-animations-with-qgis-atlas-995d7ddb2d67

2020-11-10  Looked at raw hurricane data, trying to decide what data to visualize

            Brainstormed how to process data

2020-11-11  Project progress discussion #2
            * https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/automating_map_creation.html

            Decided to visualize animation of hurricane locations over the years and a
            static graph of number of hurricanes over the years (likely bar plot)

2020-11-14  Started on processing script
            * read in hurricane data (csv file) to pandas dataframe
                * https://pandas.pydata.org/
            * selected subset of data
            * began creating bar plots using matplotlib
                * https://matplotlib.org/

2020-11-18  Worked on project
              * Finished processing script
              * Started on visualizations
              * Worked on project process document
              * Worked on README

2020-11-19  Worked on project
              * Finished visualizations
              * Submitted email deliverables
              * Worked on .Rmd

2020-11-20  Finalized project deliverables
              * processing script
              * project process document
              * README
              * .Rmd
