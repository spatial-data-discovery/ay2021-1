2020-11-02 Data collection
        * http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.7.html 
        * downloaded tree cover, forest gained, forest yearly loss and datamask for 20N090W and 20N100W

2020-11-06 ArcPy Adventures
	    * Reclassified ForestCover layer: >70% Forest Cover as 1, and <70% as 0 (based off my work with Wildlife Conservation Society experts of the region)
	    * Reclassified datamask to only have 0 as no data and 1 as mapped land surface, removing permanent water bodies like the sea
		* Raster Calculator: forest cover (values: 0-1) - yearly forest loss (values: 0 for no loss at all, 1 for loss in 2001, 2 in 2002...15 in 2015)
	    * Raster Calculator: added forest gain (which unfortunately is only a yes or no for the ENTIRE 15 years...)
		* Raster Calculator: multiplied result with datamask such that no data and permanent water bodies with 0 values are multiplied out (because multiplication by 0)
		* Extract by attributes: clumped layers every three years, extract rasters by clump of years from both rasters
		* Convert all resultant rasters into ASCII to be processed into an animation with QGIS
		
2020-11-012 Making a good script
		*PEP8 editing: docstring, renaming variables, implementing \ to cut up string longer than PEP8 recommended length per line
		*Created try-except loops and other considerations to increase usability
		*"housekeeping" efforts to comply to requirements of assignment, such as updating process doc
		
2020-11-08 Editing for PEP8 Considerations

2020-11-18 Bulk of code has been completed
		*fixed issues surrounding extent of raster calculations. ArcPy defaults to using the intersection of rasters as its extent, which means my raster will only be as large
		as large as all the pixels found in all of my rasters (which amounts to some 100 pixels only).
		*failed to find a good way to introduce a colormap in ArcPy. Sources online say it just doesn't work as anticipated
		*changed nature of output: instead of rasters split by chunks of time for an animation, I realize that the animation won't be appealing because forest loss on a grand scale
		is tiny. Animation looks good on the EVI "Breathing" example because the changes are easily visible, but not so for my output. So I'm just doing two rasters that show
		temporal aspect of forest loss just by its values. Improves compute time as well!
		
2020-11-20 More optimizing on the cmd, and Sorted()
		*added print statements that help user understand what's happening
		*more PEP8 work on defining constants, adding first line shebang
		*testing bad inputs: allowed y and yes as part of acknowledgement, not just yes
		*added Output folder in which output is saved, with exceptions for folder existence and lack of permission (if unallowed, save in same dir)

2020-11-21		
		*Professor asked how glob orders files: they sort like the filesystem does. I've made it more robust by using Sorted(), which uses timsort.
		*Visualizations i.e. graphic creation
		*(Simple) Rmd creation.
