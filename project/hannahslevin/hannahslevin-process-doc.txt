2020-10-13	Beginning the project
		* Created project folder in ay-2021.github.io repository with README and process doc
		* Uploaded a blank template project-hannahslevin.Rmd file to spatial-data-discovery.github.io 

2020-11-03	Started brainstorming 
		* Came up with two main ideas:
			* Utilizing  data to understand gerrymandering
			* Looking at drug usage over time
		
2020-11-09	Began the search for data 
		* Preliminarily decided to research drug usage over time
		* Searched the internet for data on drug usage and laws
		* Found preliminary data from:
			* Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminstration 
			* CDC
			
2020-11-15	Officially decided on a topic and dataset
		* During the search for drug data, I found that data on drug usage is not usually publicly available
		* I realized I could either hone in on drug legalization, which is more publicly available, or choose a new topic
		* I ultimately decided upon looking at healthcare, specifically in American prisons
		* Downloaded PDF data from https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr096.pdf on prison healthcare
		
2020-11-21	Processed Data
		* Used tabula-py to export pdf tables to pandas dataframes to csvs
		
2020-11-22	Converted CSVs to Spatial Data
		* Downloaded USA state level data from https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html
		* Performed spatial join in QGIS with the geoboundaries USA ADM 1 shapefile and the admissions_screening csv I created in my script
		
2020-11-23	Visualized Data
		* Created Visualizations for aggregated admissions screening data by state using ArcGIS Pro via the Virtual Desktop 
		* Created Visualizations for each individual admissions screening criteria by state using ArcGIS Pro via the Virtual Desktop 
		* Created gif of each admissions screening map using imageio
