2020-10-19: Searched for datasets
            * Found nighttime lights dataset: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_DMSP-OLS_CALIBRATED_LIGHTS_V4
            * Decided dataset would be too difficult to work with

2020-10-26: Searched for other datasets
            * Found first sea-ice dataset: https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=981
            * Decided against first dataset, as it was too old and not well representative of North and South Poles
            * Found second sea-ice dataset: https://nsidc.org/data/G02135/versions/3
            * Chose the second dataset, as it was very recent and very well representative of North and South Poles

2020-11-04: 1st discussion about project progress
            * Discussed converting GeoTIFF files into ASCII raster format
            * Dr. Davis suggested rasterio: https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
            * Decided to compare how much ice melted in 1979-1980 with 2019-2020

2020-11-05: Wrote processing script and made visualization for North Pole
            * Processing script converts GeoTIFF files into more familiar ASCII raster format
            * Struggled with GIMP and FFmpeg, but eventually got a finished product: https://spatial-data-discovery.github.io/resources-methods.html#converting-images-to-animations
            * New ASCII raster files won't open in QGIS due to cell size, may try to scale down
            * Decided against 1979-1980 with 2019-2020 comparison, now investigating ice coverage every 5 years since 1980

2020-11-06: Made visualization for South Pole (same process as North Pole visualization)

2020-11-09: Fixed cell size issue in processing script
            * Discovered I was foolishly squaring the true cell size, which explained why it was far too big for QGIS to load

2020-11-10: Added functionality to processing script and made website
            * I did so to hopefully fulfill the unique processing techniques/creativity requirement and to improve my comparison of ice amount per raster file
            * The script now creates one .txt file describing (for each newly converted raster file) the unique cell values in the raster file, as well as the amount of each unique cell value
            * Website may need tweaking, will email Dr. Davis asking for rendering tomorrow

2020-11-11: Remade visualization and made README file for Project Folder
            * Added percent change to visualizations

2020-11-17: Fixed issue with visualizations where they would be cut off on a mobile device
            * Used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_videos.asp for help with this
