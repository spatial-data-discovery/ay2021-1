2020-10-15  Project Preparation
	* Created project workspace on git (ay2021-1/project/sylviashea1)

2020-11-03  Topic Search
	* Researching data for topics that I'm interested in.
	* Topics include:
		* Vaccination coverage
            	* The Opioid Epidemic
            	* Gun violence
	* Data availability will determine which topic I pursue.

2020-11-04  Topic Decision
	* I decided on visualizing the relationship between mass
	shootings, gun vendors, and strictness of gun control laws
	by state.

2020-11-05 Gathering Data
	* Gun law strictness scorecards from 2010 - 2019
		* Manually put scorecard data into CSV format
		* https://giffords.org/lawcenter/resources/scorecard/#rankings
	* Mass shootings from 2009 - 2019
		* https://maps.everytownresearch.org/massshootingsreports/mass-shootings-in-america-2009-2019/
	* Gun vendors in the US
		* https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2016
	* United States shape file (ADM1)
		* https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/cb_2018_us_state_500k.zip

2020-11-06 Gathering Inspiration for Viz
	* https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/
	* https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/10/gun-crime-us-state

2020-11-07 Processing the Data
	* Geocoded mass shooting data CSV
	* Geocoded gun vendors data CSV
	* Removed US territories, Alaska, and Hawaii from all datasets
	* Decided to not visualize gun stores - sorry for geocoding 80,000 rows
	for no reason

2020-11-08 Testing Visualizations 
	* Selected one year of scorecards
		* Joined to US states shapefile
	* Changed all date entries in shooting data to separate columns for month
	and year
	* Plotted law strictness as choropleth map
	* Plotted shooting incidents with circle (graduated symbol - larger with
	more shots fired)
	* Modified legend for choropleth map
	* Added numbers to circles on map (indicating total shot)

2020-11-10 Writing main script
	* Goal: creates map for each month of each year between 2009 - 2020
		* Reads in all files
		* Cleans all files
		* Joins law strictness to shape file, stores in dict {year: df}
		* Loop through years, months
			* Select law strictness shapefile by year
			* Select subset of mass shooting dataframe by date
			* Plot shootings and law strictness for month and year
			* Generate map as PNG

2020-11-15 Finalizing visualization
	* Decided on final color scheme for choropleth map
	* Decided on final color for shooting markers
	* Decided on fonts for text

2020-11-16 Generated plots and video script
	* Ran main script to generate plot for every month of each year
		* It actually worked the first time wow
	* Worked on script to turn plot pngs into video
		* Tried cv2, imageio, skvideo.io, moviepy
		* Some images were different sizes, which prevented the modules
		from building the video
		* Tried to resize and regenerate plots-nothing worked

2020-11-17 Making video
	* Could not get video module to work
	* Decided to do it manually via:
		* Using script from stack overflow to download Jupyter 
		directory that contained all plots
		* Adding all images to iMovie
		* Made each image have duration of 1 second
		* Fit video to screen
	* Trouble with resolution
		* When exporting iMovie, didn't have the option for lower pixel size
		to satisfy 910> requirement
		* Used moviepy to resize video
		* Movie not compatible with quicktime (despite being mp4/MPEG4 type)
		* Downloaded Elmedia player, a third party video display software
		* Can view video, looks good
	* This process was a nightmare
	* Shoutout to Professor Davis for using FFMPEG to resize the original video
