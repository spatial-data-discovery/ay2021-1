*******************************************************************************

2020-10-12	Created project folder
		Explored potential datasets pertaining to tropical precipitation
		Decided to pursue a project pertaining to animal populations/distributions
		Explored potential datasets pertaining to hummingbird flight patterns over time

2020-10-13	Searched for datasets pertaining to salmon tracking
		Searched for datasets pertaining to fish tracking, overall
		Searched for datasets pertaining to fish species tracking along the US east coast

2020-10-14	Considered changing project topic to tracking hurricane paths over time 

2020-10-15	Searched for datasets pertaining to annual hurricane tracking
		Searched for datasets pertaining to precipitation over time

2020-10-19	Setup README file

2020-10-20	Sifted through various dataset options I found (from among both fish and weather tracking) to remove any that didn't record tracking data recently or on an annual basis

2020-10-25 	Read further detail about various datasets found in previous searches to narrow down options that included the level of location data I would need for visualizations

2020-10-26	Found and decided upon a CSV file from NOAA Fisheries: [Green Sturgeon by NOAA](https://noaa-fisheries-swfsc.data.socrata.com/Species/Green-Sturgeon-Acoustic-Monitoring/cbdw-sw7g)
		This dataset stores data about Green Sturgeon tracking since 2002 along the coast of central California and was last updated March 12, 2020

2020-11-04	Discussed ideas for visualizations and tools to create them during class's breakout room session
		Tried out visualization techniques in kepler.gl software, per Andrew's suggestion 

2020-11-09	Began writing Python script to load CSV file into a dataframe
		Created new CSV file containing only the location, timestamp, and tracking/fish ids from the original dataset

2020-11-10	Created first scatterplot visualization of longitude and latitude data

2020-11-11	Completed first portion of Python script that processes and cleans original dataset and outputs a new CSV file
		Began working on the portion of the Python script that will make visualizations using the GeoPandas library
            	Created and updated project Rmd file for Spatial Data Discovery website repository (https://github.com/spatial-data-discovery/spatial-data-discovery.github.io)

2020-11-12	Completed conversion of dataframe to GeoDataframe and continued evaluating potential visualizations
		Realized that the CSV file downloaded from the NOAA website/data source did not span the entire collection time period, and thus determined a new dataset would be necessary to create a meaningful analysis and/or visualization
		
2020-11-13	Found a new NOAA dataset created in collaboration with Rutgers University that contained location data on a wide variety of marine species since 1977 (most recent entry is dated to 2019)
		Switched focus of project from changes in spatial distribution of Green Sturgeon populations along the coast of California over time to that of various shrimp species across North America
		Link to the new dataset: [Ocean Adapt by NOAA & Rutgers University](https://oceanadapt.rutgers.edu/)

2020-11-16	Edited original Python script so that it would function properly with the new dataset (i.e., process and clean dataset, output a new CSV file, and convert DataFrame to GeoPandas DataFrame)

2020-11-18	Adjusted script to fit PEP8 style guide
		Created data visualizations in kepler.gl

2020-11-19	Created plot visualizations with GeoPandas

2020-11-20	Created video animation of data visualizations created in kepler.gl
		Put together final updates for Rmd and process document, and organized project submission email and directories
