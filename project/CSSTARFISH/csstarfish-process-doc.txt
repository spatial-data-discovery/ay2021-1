*******************************************************************************

2020-10-12	Created project folder
		        Explored potential datasets pertaining to tropical precipitation
		        Decided to pursue a project pertaining to animal populations/distributions
		        Explored potential datasets pertaining to hummingbird flight patterns over time

2020-10-13	Searched for datasets pertaining to salmon tracking
		        Searched for datasets pertaining to fish tracking, overall
		        Searched for datasets pertaining to fish species tracking along the US east coast

2020-10-14	Considered changing project topic to tracking hurricane paths over time 

2020-10-15	Searched for datasets pertaining to annual hurricane tracking
		        Searched for datasets pertaining to precipitation over time

2020-10-19	Setup README file

2020-10-20	Sifted through various dataset options I found (from among both fish and weather tracking) 
		        to remove any that didn't record tracking data recently or on an annual basis

2020-10-25 	Read further detail about various datasets found in previous searches to narrow down options that
		        include the level of location data I will need

2020-10-26	Found and decided upon a CSV file from NOAA Fisheries (https://noaa-fisheries-swfsc.data.socrata.com/Species/Green-Sturgeon-Acoustic-Monitoring/cbdw-sw7g)
		        This dataset stores data about Green Sturgeon tracking since 2002 along the coast of central California and was last updated March 12, 2020

2020-11-04	Discussed ideas for visualizations and tools to create them during class's breakout room session
		        Tried out visualization techniques in kepler.gl software, per Andrew's suggestion 

2020-11-09	Began writing Python script to load CSV file into a dataframe
		        Created new CSV file containing only the location, timestamp, and tracking/fish ids from the original dataset

2020-11-10	Created first scatterplot visualization of longitude and latitude data

2020-11-11	Completed first portion of Python script that processes and cleans original dataset and outputs a new CSV file
		        Began working on the portion of the Python script that will make visualizations using the GeoPandas library
            Created and updated project Rmd file for Spatial Data Discovery website repository (https://github.com/spatial-data-discovery/spatial-data-discovery.github.io)
