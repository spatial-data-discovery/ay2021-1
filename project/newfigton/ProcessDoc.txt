		Files are in "games" folder of Github

	   https://github.com/hohav/py-slippi

10-25-2020 Installed Seaborn python package

10-28-2020 Followed along with Swoodivarius' script to pull neutral wins and create basic heatmaps. I use many of his methods in my final code

11-05-2020 Install GIMP 2.10.22 to make transparent move library
		https://www.gimp.org/

11-22-2020 Correspond with Hohav (creator of Slippi Python Parser) to troubleshoot error I'm getting. Its turnips!
		Turnips were a continuous source of annoyance for this project

11-23-2020 Accepted that no Python library exists that will let me efficiently graph points using custom images. 
	   Contact lloD for more data files to create comparison images, don't recieve data in time

11-24-2020 Clean code; convert graphing/calculations to methods as much as possible. Code is still ugly but better. Changed a few things to 		make it easier to implement multiple characters in future work. 
		
		Wrote project write-up and uploaded files to github

		Converted visualizations into videos and then GIFs using Windows Photos and then Imgur
